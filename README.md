<h2>ü§î Why?</h2>

<p>I was looking some pens on CodePen, and suddenly i found <a href="https://codepen.io/irajsuhail/pen/mYMZVm">this</a>. And i thought "Wow, that's incredible" so i decided to try and make my own keyboard with HTML & CSS. And i did it, but still wanted something more spicy and suddenly the idea of making the linux terminal came. The result is a "functional" terminal where you can do basic commands.</p>

<h2>üî® Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A functional terminal</li>
  <li>A functional keyboard</li>
  <li>Some basic commands, type <code>cmd</code> or <code>help</code> to see</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Responsivity ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>
I'm not planning on making this project responsive, so the only way you can visualize it is on your pc

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Visual studio code</li>
  <li>The <strong>Live server</strong> extension</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualization</h2>

You can see the project by following these steps:

<ol>
  <li>clone this repo by opening your terimal and pasting: <code>git clone https://github.com/AspetereCoder/HTMLTerminal.git</code></li>
  <li>open the folder with your visual studio code</li>
  <li>go the html file and click "Go Live", this will open the file in your browser</li>
  <li>and finally open the index.html file with live server extension</li>
</ol>
